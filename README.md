# Wine-Cluster-Hierarchical-and-K-Means

**Overview**

These data are the results of a meticulous chemical analysis of wines cultivated in the enchanting region of Italy. Originating from three distinct cultivars, the dataset unveils the intricate details of 13 key constituents found in each wine type from Alcohol to Color intensity. The dataset includes the following variables:

Alcohol

Malic Acid

Ash

Ash Alcanity

Magnesium

Total Phenols

Flavanoids

Nonflavanoid Phenols

Proanthocyanins

Color Intensity

Hue

OD280

Proline

**Context**

The Wine dataset is commonly used for clustering tasks, aiming to group wines based on their chemical composition. This dataset provides an opportunity to explore and analyze the inherent patterns in wine characteristics.

**Clustering Models Used**

In this analysis, both Hierarchical Clustering and K-Means Clustering algorithms have been employed to cluster the wines. The clustering analysis resulted in a silhouette score of approximately 0.66.
